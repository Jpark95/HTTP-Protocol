TritonHTTP is a client-server protocol that is layered on top of a reliable stream-oriented transport protocol (typically TCP). Clients issue request messages to the server, and servers reply with response messages. In its most basic form, a single HTTP-level request-reply exchange happens over a single, dedicated TCP connection. The client first connects to the server, sends the HTTP request message, the server replies with an HTTP response, and then the server closes the connection.
